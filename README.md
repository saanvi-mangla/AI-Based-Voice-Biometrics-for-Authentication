# AI-Based-Voice-Biometrics-for-Authentication
Authentication is the backbone of secure digital transactions, but traditional
methods of authentication such as passwords to biometrics (fingerprints) can
be compromised by phishing, spoofing, and hardware dependencies. Voice
biometrics provides a disruptive solution to these issues by utilizing specific
unique aspects of each user's voice, such as pitch, tone, or spectral properties,
to provide secure and non-invasive authentication. The project will
demonstrate the construction of an AI powered voice biometric authentication
system with the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to verify users based on their voiceprints.

Motivation:

• Security: Voice biometrics can reduce the cost of serious credential theft
and replay attacks as it utilizes dynamic speaker-specific features.

• Accessibility: Voice biometrics authentication models do not require any
hardware other than a microphone, making it accessible to low-
resourced countries.

• Scale: AI models such as GMMs can utilize large datasets to verify users
in real-time.

• User Experience: Voice biometrics does not ask the user memorize
passwords while adding a natural interaction medium.
